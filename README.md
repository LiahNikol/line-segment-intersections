# line-segment-intersections
GitHub repo for Spring 2021 Computational Geometry project

This project will implement a python visualization of the sweepline algorithm using the pyglet graphics library. It will take a set of line segments as input. As a part of our visualization, we will include a visual representation of the data structures used to carry out this algorithm. This projects will output the number of intersections found as well as their location.
